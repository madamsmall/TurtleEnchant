This addon exists entirely to make the Turtle Wow enchanting interface more friendly. Allows sorting by armor type or bonus type. Gets rid of the autoscrolling issue in the basic version. 
Allows user to search and filter by 'have materials'

Known issue -- if you try to create the same item multiple times in a row while the list is filtered it may forget what you had selected because the list changes as your available materials change. 
Avoid this by not having any filtering if you want to do the same item over and over in succession. 


Note: TurtleWow 1.12 client cannot have a Create All button for items like Wands, Oils, Enchanted Leather, etc. They require hardware input so will not be included.
