This addon exists entirely to make the Turtle Wow enchanting interface more friendly. Allows sorting by armor type or bonus type. Gets rid of the autoscrolling issue in the basic version. 
Allows user to search and filter by 'have materials'


Note: TurtleWow 1.12 client cannot have a Create All button for items like Wands, Oils, Enchanted Leather, etc. They require hardware input so will not be included.
